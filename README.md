Node View Count
======================

Node View Count module counts node views. Unlike the statistics module, this
module records each view of a node with the user uid and timestamp. This allows
us to count how many times the same person viewed node by day, week, or month.

  Note: If you want to count anonymous vuews you must choose JavaScript.
